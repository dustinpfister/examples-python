# python-getting-started

This is a collection of python examples that are to be included in the getting started post on my collection of content on python. What I am writing here in this readme is just a few quick notes for the post on this collection of examples.

## s1-hello-world

This section should include not just a basic hello world example of python, but also some additional scripts that ghave to do with setting a shebang for python when it comes to making a python script executable. 

When it just comes to choosing a shebang there is all ready a great deal to write about. There is typically more than one binary on a system, and there are note worthy diferences between python, python2, python3, python3.7, ect.

This section should also touch base on using a python binary directly, make sure to have a few bash scripts that involve using a python binary to call a script, piping in python code by way of the standard input, and also using the python console.
