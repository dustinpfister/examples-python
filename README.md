# examples-python

I thought I would start working on a few python examples as I have been toying with the idea of learning a little python for a long time. So if I am going to start to teach myself python A repo such as this is called for that will contain all of by basic and not so basic examples as I start to learn python.


## draft folder

The draft folder contains python examples, notes, and any other resources that are part of what might become a blog post at some point in the future. The idea here is that I have at any moment at least a few draft folders in the works and when a draft folder is in good shape it is ready to be part of the for-post folder.

## for-post folder

The for-post folder contains a folder for each blog post that I have written on python thus far.
