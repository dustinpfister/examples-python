# python-example-dice

This is the first python applaction example that I have made that is just a simple little CLI tool for generateing a roll of dice. The example makes use of several python built in stndard libraries that I have covered in various plog posts inclduing argparse, os, and sys.

I want to keep this example simple not just for others but my own sake as well becuase I think this example should also serve as a half way decent starting point for many other examples, some of which might prove to be a little more interesting or useful.
